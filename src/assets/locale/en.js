  a deep focus in MERN and LAMP stacks. Also using Agile development techniques like Scrum. I learned how to 
  applying clean code practices and scalability patterns. Learned how to work in a team, and was Team Leader twice 
  using all my knowledge to guide my team. After graduation I was able to create an awesome website without any website 
  builder, pure code. Which makes me more able to create more personalized websites from now on`,
  workExperienceJson_description_02: `I was the UI/UX designer, website builder and maintainer of the site. I have learned 
  how to implement an appointment system with a calendar to book an appointment with the masseuse. 
  I made it mobile friendly, and made it SEO optimized for best ranking results of Google and Bing.`,
  workExperienceJson_description_03: `I was the backend web developer at Priccesa eCommerce site. PHP was necessary to 
  communicate with their logistics provider. I learned how to implement PHP to ensure a stable connection 
  between the two businesses. I was also responsible for the correct uploading of the products 
  into the database and secure payment methods with a cancellation policy.`,
  workExperienceJson_description_04: `I learned  how to develop a website for my client with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
  I was responsible for developing, maintaining and making it SEO optimized. I learned how to 
  use new technologies, create a fast loading site with cross-browser compatibility and mobile 
  responsiveness. It was about a restaurant so I used Google Maps, Apple Maps, Google Analytics, 
  Google Ads, Semrush, Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster to ensure user optimized experience 
  and high SEO ranking.`,
  workExperienceJson_description_05: `I learned using a cloud-based website builder and started my journey from there. 
  I was the UI/UX designer, website builder and maintainer. I learned to take technical decisions on my own, 
  building a website that's easy to use and understand. Helping the wireframes and sketches I made before.
  I implemented external secure payment methods and used JavaScript to create advanced sorting and filtering 
  features from scratch. In the end this was the project that made me realize the passion I have for 
  web development, and it surely didn't end there.`,
